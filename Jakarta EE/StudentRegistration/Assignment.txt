1)create a table in MySQL "student" with 
	rollno int primary key
	name varchar
	age int
	address varchar

2)now create "Student.jsp"
	accept
		rollno
		name
		age
		address

3)on submit control should go to "StudentServ".
"StudentServ" will get the request parameters and add a record in database, this servlet also will query to the database
"select rollno from student" 

4)rollno retrieved from database will be added inside ArrayList.

5)ArrayList will be stored inside "request" attribute and finally servlet will forward the request to "Report.jsp"
"Report.jsp" will retrieve ArrayList from request attribute and display rollnos. 
Here you have to use "forEach" tag of JSTL.
